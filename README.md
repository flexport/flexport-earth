# Flexport Earth Overview

Flexport Earth, an open source product that enables all participants in global trade to collaborate on creating a single source of truth for the earth’s trade information.

Flexport Earth is free to use and houses all information about global trade – from ships, planes, and trains to truck drivers, warehouse managers, and pilots. Flexport Earth is also the definitive source for the language of global trade, serving as the dictionary of terms, concepts, and standards used globally to move cargo.

Flexport Earth is powered by the global community of logistics professionals, enthusiasts, freight forwarders, and carriers. By contributing to Flexport Earth, citizens all benefit from the structured, real-time information about trade. Warehouses can manage their delivery appointments, truckers can select delivery times, and ocean vessels can collaborate with terminals – eliminating the need to rely on phone calls and emails.
