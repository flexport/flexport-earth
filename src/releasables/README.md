# What are Releasables?

Releasables are files that will be packaged as part of an Earth Release and will be promoted across environments and delivered/deployed/used in Production.

Non-Relesables (files outside of the releasables folder) do not get package and released.

# FAQ

## Why isn't the website-content folder in the releasables folder?

The website content in it's raw form is not releasable. The website content is built, and that build output is what is actually releasable.
