# Testing

## Unit Testing

We use Cypress.io for unit testing frontend code.

### Guidance

Keep your unit tests next to the code that they test.

See the [Breadcrumbs UI Component](/src/website-content/components/breadcrumbs) as an example:

```
/src/website-content/components/breadcrumbs/
- ...
- breadcrumbs.tsx
- breadcrumbs.unit-test.cy.ts
- ...
```
